They are fairly affordable and a great way to organize your suitcase.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nThe set I have is here: [OrgaWise 9 Pcs Packing Cubes,Luggage Organizer Bag with Shoes Bag Packing cubes Travel Storage Bags Packing Organizer Set, Multi-functional Clothing Sorting Packages,Travel Packing Pouches](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07TRKHG2X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n\nBefore I had these, I would do the same thing with a bunch of grocery bags or whatever. The principle is the same: you want your clean clothes organized and sorted by type so it's easy to get at them. Your dirty clothes are anything not in a packing cube. They just keep everything organized and you can quickly lay them out on a bed or something to pick out an outfit. I don't believe there is any real space saving from compression or whatever, this is purely me liking the look of the cubes in the suitcase and being able to differentiate easily between clean and dirty clothes.

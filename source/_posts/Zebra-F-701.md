I saw this pen on a Reddit EDC post.

[Zebra F-701 Ballpoint Stainless Steel Retractable Pen, Fine Point, 0.7mm, Black Ink, 1-Count](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B002L6RB80/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1)

This is a steel pen that is very affordable but feels solid in the hand. I purchased it to throw in with EDC kits or my pocket. No chance of it getting stepped on a crushed, etc. The cartridge is sealed and pressurized so it writes at all angles (this has never been an issue for me but it's nice to know) and you can apparently use space pen refills.

Still working on image sizes...

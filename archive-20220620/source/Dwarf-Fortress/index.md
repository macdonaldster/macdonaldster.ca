Planning to add notes about how I play Dwarf Fortress.


## I use Putty to play DF. I host my DF game on the same Linode server that hosts this blog.
- Use TMUX to create a session so you can connect and disconnect at will.
- "Thank you, Apparently Xterm R6 is what DF needs for using the F1-F12 keys. Now I can navigate many Z layers at once, so awesome." https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/18d6j6/anyone_else_play_df_using_putty_over_ssh/

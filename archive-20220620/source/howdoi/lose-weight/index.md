## I don't know...

Weight loss has always been an issue for me. I have high blood pressure, my weight makes arthritic problems worse, and I am generally aware of it being a warning sign for how out of shape I am. And I have a young son. I should not need further motivation to lose weight. But I do!

I have tried many, many things to lose weight. Some have been very successful. I once lost 65 lbs. by eating under 1,500 kcal/day and working out (I exercised every day, if I couldn't do anything else I would do 20 minutes of skipping rope in the garage). The single minded discipline to do this turned me into a monster. I couldn't enjoy anything because of calorie counting, I was obsessed with getting my trend weight down. I basically hit a wall at some point and gained all that weight back in 3 months. I wasn't even going nuts, I was just eating "normally" (which, for me, is excessively).

Now I know a lot more about food and nutrition. I have tried various things and know what works. I like low carb but I have a problem with my ostomy not tolerating it well. I get into this flushing cycle and need something to stop it (psyllium fiber is great for this and has no carbs but it can dangerous to load up on it when you ostomy is inflamed and trying to flush itself out). I end up having "some bread" or something and then I crave it. It's a vicious cycle.

I'd like to start journalling here about how I am losing weight "today" so I can keep track of what I am trying and what is working. My wife and I just lost a significant amount of weight and then I think I put it all back on again (haven't weighed myself)! I won't get into the circumstances but let's just say we are very motivated but I let myself slide back. The things we have been doing worked, though. I am going to continue on with this but modified to work for me. I won't bother trying to label this. I am just going to do what I think will work.

So, current plan will always be on top:

### 2018-09-14

Starting weight? 267.3 lbs

* Breakfast - oatmeal! with some milk and salt, maybe some walnuts, not too much
* Lunch - salad or no-carb leftovers
* Dinner - our standard no-carb dinner with under 1/4 cup of the starch made for my son, occasional cheat meals dictated by my wife as she has more self-control
* Nightime snacking - NO - try not to snack AT ALL... I'll see how this goes.

* Exercise - right now, just working around the house, trying to keep moving. And I am trying to do my daily stretching (for my AS).

So lately I have been using an Android app called [aTimeLogger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aloggers.atimeloggerapp). I remove all the default entries and then just set up some generic work entries plus, as I go, entries for each project I work on. Then, I email myself the daily reports at the end of the day. This is far simpler than Toggl because the app is much smoother to use once configured correctly (Toggl's Android app seems very slow to me) and switching contexts is easy once it is set up to pause other running timers. Anything I might work on is all there as notifitcations to resume the timer with. Very slick.

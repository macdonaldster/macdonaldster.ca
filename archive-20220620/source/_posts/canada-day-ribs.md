This is the technique I used to make the best ribs yet on our Big Steel Keg:

*   Light charcoal and burn it until it is well lit.
*   Vents wide open and let it burn until thermometer reads 400+
*   Close vents down to a little under 2 (top and bottom)
*   Put the ribs on directly on grill (top position)
*   Get the grill temp down to 250.
*   Leave for an hour and a half.
*   Turn, leave for an hour or so
*   Turn, dress with BBQ sauce every 30 minutes until done

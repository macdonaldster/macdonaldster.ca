Quick break from work to move and clear my head:

*   Currently shredding - old line of credit statements from 2008 for an account that's been closed for years.
*   Currently trying to exercise - 20 seconds of intense running in place as often as I think of it, in between normal day to day stuff like getting up for a glass of water or something.
*   Currently trying to eat - less - we purchased a sourdough starter recently and I've been making bread from it every couple of days since I have to feed it anyway. So eating less is not going very well but I am doing my best to moderate my bread eating.

Check out this timeline for Ferris Bueller's Day Off: http://www.80s.com/saveferris/essays/moss.txt

Do you remember that movie? It seemed like that day went on forever. He packed so much into it!

Well, that is how my day off today is supposed to go. I got up at my usual time (hint: this is really, really early) so I could get enough lead time on the day to make it work. I also will give as much help as I can in getting our boy ready for daycare (normally I do more in this regard, including dropping him off, but I can't do it today). 

So here's what my day entails:

1. Taking my car to the garage for an inspection and oil/filter change by 8AM
2. Reading while there on my Kobo
2. Possibly hit a grocery store to make sure we have what we need for dinner 
3. Getting some lunch - [Burger Baron](https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOyiyBCjv069VmOw4cT-tXnImNHOBT-MhY84iPB=s512) perhaps? I know: this isn't low carb. :(
4. Returning home - let the dog out, regret eating carbs, plan dinner
5. Straighten up office - I still have a lot of disorganized crap and unfiled papers, etc. Plus a moving box to finish unpacking (we still have a bunch of these filled with random crap, I keep one in my office at all times and unpack and put it away a little at a time).
5. 20 minute nap
6. Start dinner prep
7. Get the boy - life resumes (quick dinner, soccer practice, etc)

To an outside observer this might look like "take the car in, clean office". That's really all I'm going to get done. What I'd like to do is just watch a movie and sleep but I'll try to make the best of it. 

Edit [06:00] - this is the best tweet ever:

I've been doing a lot of travel and am considering a new bag for my personal stuff. My current one was chosen for a very specific reason and I no longer use it in that way so some of its idiosyncrasies are driving me nuts.

Some things I'll be looking for in the new one:

*   Laptop, Kobo, and notebook easily stored
*   Will not fly open spilling everything if the zipper fails
*   External water bottle pocket
*   No extra straps or cords that get caught up
*   Two external pockets. One for extra stuff that is larger (cords, tools, pens) and a smaller one for keys, etc.
*   Quick access to main compartment.
*   No waist or chest strap

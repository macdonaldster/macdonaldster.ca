I had a dream that a blind master was teaching me the tea ceremony.

He said, "you know everything I know, now".

We had a good laugh because I knew nothing at the time. He had just told me some little thing like how to hold a spoon.

We are taught to have a mind like water but also that the mind should be an empty vessel that we will fill. The only way these can be true at the same time is if the mind is made of ice. Cold. Still. Nothing is more impermanent than ice when placed into the environments where people live.

Let that one sink in. Watch it melt.

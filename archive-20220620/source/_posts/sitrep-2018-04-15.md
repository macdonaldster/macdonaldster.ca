- down about 15 lbs in three weeks, I guess... I've lost the weight I regained on vacation and am losing again. Eating like a King, too. Feels like cheating. Breakfast was a keto mug bread grilled cheese with bacon, strawberries, and an egg. Lunch was a Boston Pizza sandwich entree, hold the bread and fries with Cesar Salad. Dinner was a bunless burger, Greek salad, and mushrooms fried with spinach and garlic. Later we had keto cheesecake for dessert. I mean that's good eats.

- we took our boy to the park today and went for a nice drive outside the city. Beautiful weather.

- that is all... Work in the morning.

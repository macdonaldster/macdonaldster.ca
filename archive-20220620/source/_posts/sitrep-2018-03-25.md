Last Sunday we started keto and since then I've lost about 10 lbs. Having an ostomy has meant that going without carbs leads to lots of trips to the washroom after each meal. And while I felt great at first, I was getting pretty fun down by today. 

Because of this I'm adding a few more carbs (starch) back into the mix but keeping it minimal. Just enough to make dealing with the ostomy a little easier. I'll monitor my weight and scale back of weight loss ceases.

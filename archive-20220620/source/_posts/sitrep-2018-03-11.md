There's much to say. 

Attended an all day seminar/education thing on Friday re AS to learn more about how this is going to progress over the next 20 years and what I can do about it. Learned much, met people like me.

Other than the backslides I've already talked about I've been doing well with my eating and the TMJ thing is responding to using a bite plane. Yay. 

Life goes on. I've been trying to remember the Sanchin kata lately. Getting there. Feels good to do that again.

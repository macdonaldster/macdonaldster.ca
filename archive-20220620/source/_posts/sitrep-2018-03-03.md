This week I ended up being uncomfortably full three times. Granted I seem to be fighting a bug I felt exhausted, lethargic, and nauseated afterward. Really bad. Not just uncomfortable, more like "I might throw up".

So I'm going to really try to not get full. It's pointless. After my Ostomy operation I terrified of overeating and gradually got back into my old habits. That was a huge mistake. 

Anyway, I'll try to keep myself accountable here and record how I'm doing.

My (new) doctor has informed me that the best way to manage my chronic illness is to lose weight. I've been gaining it since we moved here. He suggested a low carb diet so I'm going to do my best to stick to that. I owe it to my son to be as healthy as possible for him and that needs to be my motivation.

Tomorrow we get the house inspection results (and a chance to walk around in the house) at what is hopefully our new home. Fingers crossed, but not expecting a problem.

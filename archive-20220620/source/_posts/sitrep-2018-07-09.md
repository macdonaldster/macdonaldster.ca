I haven't posted for a while. Not sure why. I stopped the clock on my work timer so I could write this up quickly (so this is not time theft, I am clearing my thoughts).

Some achievements:

- clothes reorganization was a success... still not perfect but using less space and much easier to get at the clothes I need, etc. 
- health - stretching regularly again
- bedding storage - I have a plan, bins! Going to execute this week and make it super easy to store and retrieve laundered sheets and bedding while keeping the laundry room looking tidy

Some frustrations:

- fitness - still not making the time but I have a plan and it is going to work, I think. I HAVE been getting in my stretching more regularly so feeling good about that
- waking early - I am not having good luck with this... I still end up feeling groggy... might just go back to getting up a little later and forgetting about trying to do things like exercise or write in the morning... I end up hitting "snooze" more often than just getting up and even when I get up early I am too tired.
- morning pages - yeah, this went OK for a couple of days but I am so drowsy when I wake up I forget to do it... so I'll try later in the morning.

OK, going back to work... My damn fingers are killing me from the arthritis so typing this actually helps (since movement leads to relief).

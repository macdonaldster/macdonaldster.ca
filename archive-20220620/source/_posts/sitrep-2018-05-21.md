Day 2 and start of day 3:

- Stanley Park - really incredible park and a great beach. It was nice to smell the ocean and get our get wet. A large heron was hunting for worms very close to where our son was playing in the mud flats. Very cool.

- Our day started with the Lynn Canyon suspension bridge. So incredible. The views are mindblowing and so are the very tall, old trees you see all around you. Definitely a good spot for "forest bathing".

- Not much to report on the culinary front as we've been mostly cooking in our airbnb and trying to stay low carb but we might get off the plan for some excellent pizza. Looking for a place now!

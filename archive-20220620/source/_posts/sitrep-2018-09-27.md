OK, I have 2 minutes left on my lunch break.

My use of Google Sheets has been the most productive period of my life. I really like how it is so customizable but I don't spend a lot of time fiddling with it. This is a great thing. See: https://macdonaldster.ca/howdoi/manage-my-tasks/

Health-wise, I am sleeping pretty well and eating OK although the last two days haven't been stellar (keeping it under control, though).

The whole US Supreme Court thing is like a waking nightmare. Please just kick this monster to the curb. Let's get to the mid-terms, already!

Trying to walk the dog more!

My son is learning to ride a bike. Mom rides up front, he follows behind with training wheels on. Dad walks briskly beside him offering encouragement, preventing scraped elbows, and giving a little push on the uphill parts. Well, last night he started to get fast. Faster than a walking pace but less than a moderate jog. So I jogged beside him.

This was incredible. I used to love running but haven't really done it since the operation and find I don't really "have time to run". But all of a sudden it's nice out and he's on his bike after dinner and I am getting to go for a brief, light job. This is pretty good stuff, here, people. :)

Take a container ship. Fill as much of the cargo space as possible with batteries inside containers. Cover as much surface area as possible with solar panels. Take the ship down near the equator. You can take your time, just using enough power to stay on course. Charge the batteries. Come back up to New York or Boston. Switch up with another, identical ship, and supply power to the city grid while the other ship charges. With enough of these using minimal crew and fuel, would it work?

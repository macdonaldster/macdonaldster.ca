I am going to set up my blog to auto-generate using a cron job. This means I can just create a blog file anywhere (phone, laptop, vps, etc) and save it then Hexo will re-gen my blog periodically. It is conceivable that this will result in partially completed entries showing up since I use auto-save in every editor except Emacs on the VPS. 

If it works this blog post should update and display this line at 15:15.

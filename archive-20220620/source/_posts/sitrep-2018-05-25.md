Day 7?

- Leaving for home tomorrow morning from Tofino. 
- Started using Multiling O Keyboard this trip. I spent a lot of time configuring it but I'm pretty happy with it now. Prediction  seems to improving as I use it... 
- The place we are staying I'm Tofino is tiny and had zero light blocking so our son is not going to sleep well at all. It's a bit of a nightmare.

New anti-drug plan for teens:

- get them in a room with really good acoustics and show them a high quality video of Jimi Hendrix playing Bold As Love...
- then have some cool person (Jason Priestly? The Rock? I don't know what kids are into these days) tell them that Hendrix died as a fairly young man because he was wasted and that he will never record again...

I mean it won't stop them from smoking pot but might make them think twice about going overboard?

Just a quick jot to note that I got Syncthing set up between my VPS, phone, and workstation this weekend and am blown away. Took a little bit of time to figure it all out (more because I didn't get to sit down and work on it, just picked away at it here and there) but it is syncing like a champ. I am editing this file on my workstation, it will sync to VPS, and then I will set up a Cron to regenerate the site (sometime, I will do this one manually). Easy as pie. No need for Drive and Dropbox now.

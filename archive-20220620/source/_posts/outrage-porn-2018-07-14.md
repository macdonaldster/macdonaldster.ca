I just went down a rabbit hole on YouTube following a chain of videos where Jordan Peterson was apparently "owning libs" and "destroying feminism". What was actually going on was reasoned debate and discussion between him and people slightly to the Left. 

The videos, though, were edited to have childish reaction graphics like a visual laugh track telling the viewer how outraged to feel. These were really extreme reactions that had very little to do with the actual context. In the video where he is "destroying feminists" the two women are largely agreeing with him, the interviewer is doing her job by pushing him a little, and everyone is being respectful. If you were incapable of following what was being said and just relied on predudice and the reaction graphics you'd think it was a completely different, and fictional, conversation. 

The Bill Maher clip was actually worse as the video makers were editing in  violent footage of the Charlottesville riot including the car plowing through the crowd. I think the viewer is supposed to be on the side of the alt right at the rally or you are supposed to be afraid of what the Trump people will do once he's impeached or convicted. It isn't really clear (I am definitely not the target audience).

This experience really has reinforced my belief that critical thinking is declining and people want to be spoon fed thier echo chamber media even when it makes no sense. From my pespective this is a much, much bigger problem on the right but the left has these people, too. 
 something and something else stopping them. There needs to be a cost to be paid, something risked.

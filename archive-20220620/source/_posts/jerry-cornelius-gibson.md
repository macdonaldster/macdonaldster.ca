I am shocked at how little I am finding re the similarities between William Gibsons writing style and that of Michael Moorcock's Jerry Cornelius work.

It is obvious that they are connected and I would hesitate to use the word derivative but the similarities are striking to me now as I re read some Cornelius stuff.

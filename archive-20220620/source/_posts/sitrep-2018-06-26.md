I think I am experiencing some kind of auto-immune flareup or a general malaise.

Going to update this as the day goes on. 

I found a replacement for my habit of eating crackers and butter late at night. Salami "chips" and cream cheese. This provides the butter spreading action, the creaminess, the automatic eating, etc without the carbs. Trying to stick to the keto. Doing my best.

*   500g flour
*   350g water
*   2 tsp yeast
*   1 cup Sourdough starter
*   1 tbsp salt
Needed a quick dough for dinner so I made this. The levain isn't being kept very acidic but the dough still had more character than a standard yeast dough.

Topped the pizza with bacon, mushrooms fried with the bacon, and just a little pepperoni. Tomato sauce and mozzarella. Dressed with fresh basil and pepperoncini.

Served with a peach, tomato, and strawberry salad with boconcinni and black olives dressed with baslmic vinegar and some Olive oil. Generous black pepper and lightly salted.

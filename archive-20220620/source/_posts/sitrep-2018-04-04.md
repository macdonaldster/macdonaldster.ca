You win some, you lose some. Last night I lost to lasagna.

Getting back on track today.

Been having fun with the "one index card per step of the Hero's Journey" method of writing. I did one card for "beginning, middle, end" and then am going into the steps between those main sections of the Hero's Journey and creating a card for each ("Call To adventure", "Refusal Of The Call"). Once these are done I will fill in a card for the places between these creating scene details, dialog snippets, and other building blocks. These can then be shuffled around a bit. Eventually, I will transcribe all of those cards into a linear document and begin editing (if this works).

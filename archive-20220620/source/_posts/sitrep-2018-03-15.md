So I'm feeling pretty good about what I are today. I've been patting myself on the back. I had a light breakfast and lunch and a very healthy dinner. No snacks.

Them I remember that I stopped on the way home this morning and got two sausage egg McMuffins. How could I have possibly not remembered eating those? This happened a couple of times! I kept forgetting. 

That's how my brain works.

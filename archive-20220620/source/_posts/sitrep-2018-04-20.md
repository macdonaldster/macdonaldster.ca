Look, I've been using a Pebble Time watchface for the last couple of days that has the Metric time on it right below the "normal" time. Right now, it is 10:15 and the metric time is 04.25. So the day is almost 25% done. Noon is 5. Get it? Why isn't that how we tell time? OK, I need to get back to work now.

I weigh myself every night right before bed. Tonight I was down into the next "10s". That's incredible. And I'm never hungry. I am more low carb than keto but this feels sustainable. 

At some point today I wrote something on an index card that I'm going to carry with me and think about for the next few days: "every time I make progress with fitness or diet I derail when I go on vacation or there's a holiday period". Ok, that's not what I wrote but it's close. 

I'm going to be staying with my folks for a week or so. My wife and son won't be with us. I'll be driving by a McDonald's a few times a day. There will be delicious homemade bread in the kitchen. This could be tough. I'll just do the best I can. 

Time for sleep.

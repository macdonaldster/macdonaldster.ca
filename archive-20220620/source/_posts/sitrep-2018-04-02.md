Health - successfully navigated Easter while actually losing weight. I am being a little less strict during my visit but trying to also get more activity in (and by less strict I mean "only a little").

Sleep - I miss our bed at home. I am sleeping in the bed I had from ages 6 to probably 14, I guess? Same mattress.

Writing - trying to "write a story with index cards" by creating big blocks and ideas (story points, scenes, phrases, etc) as index cards and then running through them. Just a fun project while I have some extra time to myself in the evenings.

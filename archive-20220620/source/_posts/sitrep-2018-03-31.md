Air travel today. Highlights included a guy watching Spaceballs on his laptop, my son yelling out about how stinky the plane was, a single passeger applauding the landing like a maniac, and waiting in a McDonald's drive thru line for 20 minutes with an hangry toddler only to be told they "ran out of salad a couple hours ago, actually". Got salad somewhere else, kept it low carb all day.

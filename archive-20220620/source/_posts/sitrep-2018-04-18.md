I'm up a little early because of my cold and the fact that our boy climbed into bed in the middle of the night and I didn't want to wake him up when my watch alarm buzzed.

I am down well over 15 lbs since starting low carb a few weeks ago and this includes a visit home where I put a few pounds back on. It is actually a little freaky to step on that scale in the morning and see how much I've lost. I really do put a lot of stock in the relationship of insulin to weight loss. [The Obesity Code](https://www.amazon.ca/Obesity-Code-Unlocking-Secrets-Weight/dp/1771641258/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1524048843&sr=8-1&keywords=the+obesity+code) is a pretty good book to get started with if you want a really detailed explanation of why insulin is what you should be thinking about instead of "Calories In, Calories Out". 

You can also start here: [Diet Doctor: How To Lose Weight](https://www.dietdoctor.com/how-to-lose-weight). This is the authors' site and is a boiled down guide. I think a person really needs to dig into the science here to get the best results so I would suggest the book or just Googling "insulin resistance" and reading as much as you can stand.

OK, I need to get an early start at work as I have a bunch of estimators coming to the house today, etc.

My son is 3.75 years old. I'm in my mid-40s. I have the physical age of probably 60\. There have been times in my life when I've been in good shape. Then there's now.

Do the math and figure out how old I'll be when my son graduates high school. Do I want to be at the convocation in a wheelchair? No. I want to be there feeling fit, healthy, and energetic.

So in taking a Mulligan. I starting over. I'm doing it for myself, for my wife, and for my son. Here's hoping it works.

Well, it's been a while since I experienced horror at being too full. Since then I have eaten too much once. We ordered food, it was way more than I thought, and I ate too much of it before I realized what I had done. That was lunch. I had a very small dinner and got on with life.

Exercising - working on it.

I am exeriencing some kind of pain (teeth, side of face). I either have some TMJ thing or need a root canal. I'll find out next week. It is driving me crazy. Exerting myself makes that throb like crazy so I try to keep it focused on stretching.

OK, in the midst of constant anxiety that the US is going to destroy the world I have some updates:

1. Keto - we're doing Keto! I have a lot of energy.
1. Weather - it's really nice here.
1. Daily routines - I am starting to get the hang of my life which typically means it will all be disrupted sooner rather than later. I am on the verge of having enough room at the end of a given day to do some "old paper" shredding assuming no errands to run.
1. Index card system - I am knocking off one or two minor tasks a day. This feels really good.
1. Work - going well, focusing well, Keto and coffee are quite a combo.

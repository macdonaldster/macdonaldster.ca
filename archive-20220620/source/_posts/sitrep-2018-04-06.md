- So it begins: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aaaed7/meta - when this thing can do VR, please sign me up.
- health - not really following my eating plan and it shows, weight loss has stopped even though I only "cheated" a little. Back on track today. Note: ate a donair, I'm in Halifax, what are your gonna do?
- writing - almost have an index card for each of the phase 1 aspects of the Hero's Journey outline as presented on the Wikipedia page. I am doing one a day... it is really interesting to me how this limited engagement with a story is working much better than if I were to stare at a blank page. Once all the cards are done I will go through them and fill in the blanks with other cards, slowly building it up. At some point it will turn into a single document, I suppose.
- life - got to see my oldest friends for a bit last night, I always look forward to that and enjoy it... they are like family and I regret not being able to hang out with them more but whenever we get together it's a good time.

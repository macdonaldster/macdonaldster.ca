So we're moving again. As a result I've cut back on my writing and basically all other leisure. My wife has accepted a really great job in another city and they are paying to relocate us.

I want to keep writing but I think they only way I can is to stick to ideas and notes on my phone. Eventually, we'll be settled again and I'll get back to writing.

I really enjoyed doing it but was also thinking maybe I should be programming instead. For example, I could be building a roguelike game and watching narratives emerge from that. I am not sure where this will end up but it's just a hobby so I'll just try to have fun with it whatever it is.

Last night I rubbed a brisket with salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder. Then I got up at 6:30 and fired up my smoker (Big Steel Keg). Let it around 275F until about 2pm then wrapped it in tinfoil and left it again until about 4pm. Delicious!

I followed this recipe and method:&nbsp;https://www.charbroil.com/community/smoke-beef-brisket-charcoal-grill/

Next time I do it on would use way less salt and pepper. The meat was perfect but over seasoned (still delicious).

We ate the brisket with fried, green tomatoes, roasted cauliflower, and fresh, raw peas. Pretty tasty!

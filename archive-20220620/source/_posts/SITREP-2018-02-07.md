- Physical: intense headache, Tylenol helping
- Mental: focused on work, enjoying writing code a lot again
- Psychic dread: building, worried about a couple of in-laws
- Dwarf fortress: my strength withered. Starting a new one (15 minutes a day!)

Not feeling very creative so not much writing going on.

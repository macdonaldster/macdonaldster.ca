Doing this on my lunch break so no pics today.

I have resigned myself to life as a domestic shark. Never rest. Always keep moving. There is always more to do. A good night's sleep will be my reward. I am trying to never lose my temper, either. It gets me nowhere and only teaches my son to do it and shows other people I can't handle stress. Pretty counter-productive.

Lots of family visiting over the next couple of weeks. It will be nice to see everyone. Our son is going to love having his uncle and grandfather around and so will we. Plus lots of good meals. :) ha ha

Two minutes are up.

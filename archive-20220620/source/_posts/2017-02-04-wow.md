I saw this on Reddit today and it got me thinking.

"The factory of the future will have only two employees, a man and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there to keep the man from touching the equipment.â€œ Warren G. Bennis, University of Southern California professor of business administration; adviser to Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy

... I have seen enough AI to know it will be a while before we are relying on them for everything and I know enough about dogs to know a person who really wanted to could touch the equipment any time they want if they are in charge of the dog's food supply. So not worried about Skynet so far.

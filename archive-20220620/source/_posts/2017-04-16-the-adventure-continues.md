As part of our move to a new city we have reached the following point:

*   Items have appeared in our new rental home where my spouse is at this time. She arrived on the same day as the movers and I am sure she was completely exhausted by the time she got to sleep last night.
*   Our little one, the dog, and I are living with my parents for 10 days while I completely empty and clean the house and get it ready for our next open house.
*   I am amazed at how simple it was to sit down at my mother's chromebox and just start working with my todo list, email, etc. It is one thing to have "the web" aspect of the Chrome/Google eco-system but the devices themselves take it to the next level. It is hard to explain this feeling.

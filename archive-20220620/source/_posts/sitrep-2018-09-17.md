So I decided to hold off on my first coffee until I’ve been up for a couple of hours and so far (this is pre-coffee) I don’t hate it. I feel “ok”.

This should reduce stress on my body and allow wake up more naturally. Also, that first coffee of the day will have a better effect on me, theoretically. And it saves me some time between getting up and sitting down to work.

We’ll see how it goes.

Sitting in a McDonald's Playland while my son very slowly eats fries. I successfully beat a lifetime of fast food addiction by ordering a Ceasar salad with chicken. I opted for breaded, should have gotten grilled, but I'm still well under my carbs for the day and don't feel like I "missed out". Yay.

* Boxes in my office - evenings and weekends and here and there I've gotten through 2 of the 4 large boxes in my office from the move. I have a few piles of things that need to be put away, a lot went into junk, and my file/shred stack has grown but the boxes are both empty and gone. Now on to the next one.

* Index cards - I am using index cards for my TODO system again. I missed the tactile nature. I carry a few with a pen in my pocket to act as an inbox and keep the stack of in-play cards in front of my in a little holder on my desk. I like them because they are convenient to write on anywhere. I found an old Starbucks gift box that is the perfect size for the card archive as well (might as while chronolgically file them when done).

* Exercise - I made a card to track my stretches, pushups, and trying not to eat after dinner, I'll make one up each week. I crossed off the days of this week before I made the card but I actually did do stuff on those days.

Things are looking up, I guess?

Finally, I am planning to write some longer form posts on how working as a cook shaped my mind, how I approach work, and how I handle stress. For better and for worse.

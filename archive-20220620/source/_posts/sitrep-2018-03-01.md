So today is the second day where I am feeling lethargic and nauseated. Better than yesterday, though. I made it to the end of the workday and sacked out on the couch for 20 minutes before getting into my daily routine that ends with me going to get my son at daycare. 

Notes:

* Trump: like, just, wtf... Some just want to watch the world burn.
* Index cards: so far this system has me knocking off one or two tasks a day. I love the tactile feel of running through the deck and deciding which card to put on top. I like freedom that I have when writing up the cards and taking notes on them. Generally very satisfying and effective. I change my to-do system depending on what life throws at me and for right now this is really working for me. 
* Weather - might get some snow. Might be the last gasp of winter but who knows?

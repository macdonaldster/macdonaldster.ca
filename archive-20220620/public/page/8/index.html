        <p>So I get up pretty early for work as I am working “in another timezone”. I work at home and have a lot of interests and responsibilities outside of my job so I need to track my hours closely. The early morning hours are crucial as my young son requires attention before and after daycare so these early hours are “work time” that lets me hit my hour target earlier in the day meaning more time for dinner prep, errands, and occasionally some Dwarf Fortress.</p>
<p>Lately, though, I have been getting to my desk a little later each morning. I think it is my coffee routine. So last night I made some very strong green/matcha tea plus Orange Pekoe, put it in mason jars with honey and lemon, and put it into the bar fridge in my office. Now I’m drinking that tea and shaved off 15 or 20 minutes of non-work time from my morning routine. I’ll make a nice coffee later after lunch or something.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this routine works out and gets me a little bit of my morning back.</p>

        <p>Thinking of writing one of these after I eat, before work. I take between 15 and 30 minutes for lunch, sometimes not even that. My timezone if offset from the office so sometimes I need to stuff food in while working with someone remotely, etc. No big deal, that is why they pay me.</p>
<p>So updates on my life (just personal, no family/work unless it is very, very noteworthy):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Dwarf Fortress - a forgotten beast devastated the fortress and I am down to a wave of new migrants who I can’t seem to get to join a squad. The FB is parked in a dormitory, heavily wounded, and getting attacked by various dogs and children, etc. I figured I would let it roll, hopefully figuring out how to get migrants to join the military and just finish him off at some point but am now being invaded by elves, war horses, and war bearsas payback for repeatedly raiding their seaside town. For playing only 15 minutes a day or so this is a pretty big payoff.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Health - cold is radically improved from yesterday thanks to an amazing sleep. I am going to try fitting in a post-work walk to the mailbox as this is better than intending to go at night and not going and it will result in me getting some sun.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Eating - I had a nice roast beef sandwhich with tomato and lettuce for lunch on whole grain bread. Normally, I would have put the roast beef into a grilled cheese fried in bacon fat so I think this is progress. Some nuts and a bit of chocolate rounded out the meal. And an espresso.</p>

        <time datetime="2018-02-04T10:54:09.000Z"><a href="/2018/02/04/Snow-clearing-in-Edmonton/">2018-02-04 10:54:09</a></time>

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>So I live in Edmonton, AB. The frozen North. It’s really not too bad here in the winter as I got used to the crazy freeze/thaw/blizzard winters of the East Coast growing up and I have dealt with the bone chilling, soul crushing cold of an Ottawa winter. So -20c with very, very occasional, light snow is pretty easy for me.</p>
<p>HOWEVER:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>They don’t plow the side roads and the cold weather combined with humidity makes the highways like sheets of ice. There were well over 200 accidents (see <a href="http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/another-38-crashes-reported-saturday-morning-on-edmonton-roads-following-snowfall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/another-38-crashes-reported-saturday-morning-on-edmonton-roads-following-snowfall</a>) on between Friday (2018-02-02) and Saturday at around noon. So basically a crazy situation. And this is from about 10cm of snow. I have NO idea what they are thinking with the snow clearing policy but that is how it works here.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is often a slow, steady accumulation of very dry, light snow which makes road surfaces slick, builds up over time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When there is a melt (happened once so far) things go crazy because all the layers of snow pack go from merely slick surfaces to zero friction wet skating rink ice on the roads… Spring should be fun. Fortunately, it only lasts for a few weeks, I hear.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So that’s the situation.</p>
<p>Now as a homeowner we need to keep our driveways and sidewalks clear. Approaches range from snow blowing with a leaf blower (the snow is that dry and light) to daily scraping when you pull your car into the garage, to full on snow blowing which seems to only be needed a couple of times a winter as far as I can tell. I have never liked snow blowers. The last thing I need is another thing that can break down or can lead to me getting even less exercise than I get now. So I get out there and shovel. Every house in this neighbourhood and almost every other one I’ve seen has a driveway that will park two cars generously. With the light snow, even when 10cm deep, it really takes like 15 minutes if you get a move on to get it done with a shovel. I guess if you had a serious health condition it makes sense to own a snow blower but it would be like owning a really powerful self-propelling lawn mower if you had a lawn that was 6m x 8m, was perfectly flat, and that you used maybe four times a year. I just don’t get it. And using a leaf blower to clear your driveway? It is really, really loud and takes forever. In the conditons where this is appropriate I can literally scrape my driveway in less than ten minutes. Get some exercise, people!</p>
<p>&lt;/Rant&gt;</p>

        <p>This morning I am entering the Danger Zone. My wife leaves for a visit with family gone Friday until Monday evening. This means I am way more willing to stay up late, eat too much at night and meals, and not stretch.</p>
<p>My plan: get my son into my stretching routine. The do yoga at daycare. Then I can do it with him instead of using “taking care of him” as an excuse not to do it. Eat small meals during the day. I know I’m going to snack after he goes to bed while I watch a dude movie, so keep the eating under control during the day and don’t go nuts with my snacks. Staying up late: going to watch movies at my desk, not on the couch. I am way more likely to go to bed if I do this (desk is less comfortable) and I might do creative stuff instead of just staring at an OK movie because I “can watch whatever”. I also want to get some PS4 time in.</p>
<p>Update 23:30 - going to bed. I didn’t go nuts tonight, at least. I made pizzas for my son and I and probably ate too much at dinner but I wasn’t uncomfortably full or anything. I normally would have a massive snack by now. Instead I had a couple of crackers with butter. Not health food but better than “another pizza” or worse. </p>

<p>It is obvious that they are connected and I would hesitate to use the word derivative but the similarities are striking to me now as I re read some Cornelius stuff.</p>

I use it all the time. But I found it was terrible (for me) as a TODO application.\"></a>Google Keep: this was composed in Google Keep. I use it all the time. But I found it was terrible (for me) as a TODO application.</h3><ul>\n<li>I find I am always modifying my TODO system, always adapting it to the demands of my life. Moving house, building garden boxes, keeping a grocery list, compiling a passport application. These all have slightly different requirements and I never found a one-size fits all system that did exactly what I wanted in the way I wanted it to.</li>\n<li>The system needs to be hackable. I am a programmer. I want an open system with an API and structured data. I want to be able to script things. To generate reports. To email myself a task list, to have things show up in Google Calendar (but not everything). </li>\n<li>But I don’t have time to build a system from the ground up that works perfectly on my phone, in a browser, can be printed, filtered, sorted, emailed. </li>\n<li>Open data - I really got frustrated when I would find the perfect app but for some reason I can’t easily pull out a list (e.g. groceries) and email to someone (as an emailed, plain text list) or print it on paper (like a neanderthal). This is why I was always returning to text files. But they are not easily manipulated and filtered so I turned to Google Sheets. This is actually my MAIN reason for not going with Google Tasks or Keep. Example: you send someone a grocery list (e.g.  a checklist in a note) in Keep and it is oddly formatted AND includes all the crossed off items even if hidden. What? And they are mixed in with the not-completed list items so it is hard to get rid of them. So you have to remember to delete them but what if I like just unchecking things? And with Google Tasks, I can have a nice Grocery list but how can I email it to my wife when she’s at the store and needs it quickly?</li>\n<li>I really like scanning a list. This is why I love paper so much. And I want it to be a giant list without lots of white space or the need to check numerous tags, etc. Just a list, sorted the way I want (not just be recency as Keep does!)</li>\n<li>can add columns and code to do whatever I want - I like metadata. The type of stuff I want depends on what I’m up to. I might want to add a priority field to sort on. Or maybe task dependencies. With Sheets I can just add a new column and write code against it, create reports, share those to the web as images that update in real time, etc. Very cool. And you can build forms that add to the Sheets!!! </li>\n<li>Google Sheets has an excellent Android app. It is fast and easy to use. At the grocery store I fire up my sheet, filter down to Project groceries, and have checkboxes to clear my items (and conditional formatting grays out the line and crosses the text out, customized).</li>\n<li>Can use automate + IFTTT to do instant capture bound to long press on home button on my phone. Effortless and ubiquitous capture is vital for me as I have a terrible memory. This lets me take care of things immeadiately and the app never “gets in the way”. Again, this experience is completely hackable by me. I can also do text file lists and paste them into the sheet or type into the sheet directly, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"title":"Track My Time","date":"2018-09-13T17:24:06.000Z","_content":"\nSo lately I have been using an Android app called [aTimeLogger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aloggers.atimeloggerapp).

So -20c with very, very occasional, light snow is pretty easy for me.\n\nHOWEVER:\n\n1. They don't plow the side roads and the cold weather combined with humidity makes the highways like sheets of ice. There were well over 200 accidents (see http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/another-38-crashes-reported-saturday-morning-on-edmonton-roads-following-snowfall) on between Friday (2018-02-02) and Saturday at around noon. So basically a crazy situation. And this is from about 10cm of snow. I have NO idea what they are thinking with the snow clearing policy but that is how it works here.\n\n2. There is often a slow, steady accumulation of very dry, light snow which makes road surfaces slick, builds up over time.\n\n3.

Every house in this neighbourhood and almost every other one I've seen has a driveway that will park two cars generously. With the light snow, even when 10cm deep, it really takes like 15 minutes if you get a move on to get it done with a shovel. I guess if you had a serious health condition it makes sense to own a snow blower but it would be like owning a really powerful self-propelling lawn mower if you had a lawn that was 6m x 8m, was perfectly flat, and that you used maybe four times a year.

Take some time to calculate how much \"extra\" you are paying for Illy per pound over a good coffee you would grind yourself. Then divide that into the cost of really good grinder (one you would not be disappointed with). \n   - Don't use the milk frother... buy a $10 - $40 milk frother that warms and \"whisks\" the milk on the countertop. Prosumer machines rarely froth milk efficiently and it's a pain to clean them...\n   - Fill the espresso basket until it is rounded over the top then apply 10lbs of force with the tamper... you can do this on a bathroom scale to get the force right... it only takes a few tries to figure it out... this gets a good pack for the slightly underpowered home machine normals can afford\n   - Penultimately, use \"preinfusion\". Some prosumer models pre-infuse automatically but basically: run the water pump until you see a drip of espresso and then turn it off as fast as you can (quicker the better but I have had this work even after 1/4 of the cup got extracted).

It seemed like that day went on forever. He packed so much into it!\n\nWell, that is how my day off today is supposed to go. I got up at my usual time (hint: this is really, really early) so I could get enough lead time on the day to make it work. I also will give as much help as I can in getting our boy ready for daycare (normally I do more in this regard, including dropping him off, but I can't do it today). \n\nSo here's what my day entails:\n\n1. Taking my car to the garage for an inspection and oil/filter change by 8AM\n2. Reading while there on my Kobo\n2. Possibly hit a grocery store to make sure we have what we need for dinner \n3. Getting some lunch - [Burger Baron](https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOyiyBCjv069VmOw4cT-tXnImNHOBT-MhY84iPB=s512) perhaps? I know: this isn't low carb. :(\n4. Returning home - let the dog out, regret eating carbs, plan dinner\n5. Straighten up office - I still have a lot of disorganized crap and unfiled papers, etc. Plus a moving box to finish unpacking (we still have a bunch of these filled with random crap, I keep one in my office at all times and unpack and put it away a little at a time).\n5. 20 minute nap\n6. Start dinner prep\n7. Get the boy - life resumes (quick dinner, soccer practice, etc)\n\nTo an outside observer this might look like \"take the car in, clean office\". That's really all I'm going to get done.

Weight loss via low carb - so easy... Why have I not been doing this for years? Yesterday I was in a rush and ended up getting a Carl's Jr. burger for lunch. Wrapped in lettuce. It was delicious and had 7g net carbs. And no fries. And didn't feel gross afterward. Anyway, on week two of low carb (not quite Keto here) and feeling great. No real bread cravings. I mean, yeah, I want that stuff but I can hold off for a bit. I am sure I will eat some of it when I visit my folks for a week, soon.\n\n2. Index card system task - still the best system I have found yet. Just have to get one card done a day. And keep doing that. I picked up an old army surplus index card drawer (from a giant card catalog cabinet, I guess) that I have on my desk as a card dock now. It is much easier to use than the \"close to the right size\" box I was using before as the sides grip the cards a bit so you can file through it and wedge them into a given position, etc. It also has regularly spaced divider slots for organizing sections. There are two metal dividers with it but I can make more with cardboard or whatever. This is mostly just a historical file plus a set of new, blank cards so two dividers is plenty for now.\n\n3. Getting ready to travel this week - I need to pack soon and am interested in trying some new products out to organize my suitcase. I love the time I spend living out of a suitcase (something freeing about your life just being supported by this one bag, hard to explain, makes me feel young again) but also can't wait to get home whenever I leave (the life we have built is better than any wandering mystic fictional character aspirations I might have). \n\n4.
